Game play

The players move Pinky and Brain around the maze. They cannot move into walls. If the players try to move the rats into walls, the rats do not move. Both Pinky and Brain can occupy the same space.

When they move over a Brussels sprout they eat it and the Brussels sprout character @ is replaced by the hallway character . . Each rat keeps track of how many Brussels sprouts it has eaten. When there are no Brussels sprouts left, the game ends.
